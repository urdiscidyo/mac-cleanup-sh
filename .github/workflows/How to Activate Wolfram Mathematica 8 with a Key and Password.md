## Online Activation
 
This is the easiest and recommended way to activate Wolfram Mathematica 8 for most users. The only requirement is that your computer is connected to the internet. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Launch Wolfram Mathematica 8 on your computer. You will be presented with the Wolfram Product Activation dialog[^1^].
2. In the field provided, enter your activation key and click the Activate button. The Wolfram System will then automatically generate a Math ID and retrieve a password online through a web service. This process is fully automated and upon successful activation Mathematica will launch[^1^].

## Manual Activation
 
If the machine on which you are using Wolfram Mathematica 8 does not have an internet connection, or if you are experiencing problems with online activation, then you can activate Wolfram Mathematica 8 manually. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Launch Wolfram Mathematica 8 on your computer. You will be presented with the Wolfram Product Activation dialog[^1^].
2. Click the button Other ways to activate. Then select Manual Activation[^1^]. A Math ID number is issued for manual activation and is displayed in the resulting dialog[^1^].
3. Obtain your password. You can receive your password in one of two ways[^1^]:
    - Contact Wolfram Research. Contact information can be found by clicking the "Wolfram Research" link[^1^]. You will need to provide your activation key and Math ID number.
    - Use the Wolfram User Portal to generate a password. This is accessed when you click on the link "online password generator"[^1^]. Please note that you will need to sign in to the Wolfram User Portal with your Wolfram ID and password[^2^]. You will also need your activation key and Math ID number.
4. Enter the activation key and password. In the fields provided, enter your activation key and the password you obtained in step 3. Click the Activate button[^1^]. Upon successful activation Mathematica will launch.

## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to activate Wolfram Mathematica 8 with a key and password in two ways: online activation and manual activation. We hope this article was helpful and informative. If you have any questions or problems, please contact Wolfram Customer Support.

## How to Use Wolfram Mathematica 8
 
Wolfram Mathematica 8 is a software that can help you perform various mathematical tasks, such as calculations, simulations, visualizations, programming, and more. In this section, we will give you a brief overview of how to use Wolfram Mathematica 8.
 
### The Notebook Interface
 
When you launch Wolfram Mathematica 8, you will see a notebook interface. A notebook is a document that contains both text and code. You can use notebooks to create and edit your mathematical expressions, run your code, and view your results. You can also format your notebooks with styles, graphics, and interactive elements.
 
To create a new notebook, choose File > New > Notebook. To open an existing notebook, choose File > Open. To save your notebook, choose File > Save or File > Save As.
 
### The Input and Output Cells
 
In a notebook, you can enter your code in input cells and view your results in output cells. To create an input cell, click anywhere in the notebook and start typing. To evaluate an input cell, press Shift+Enter or click the Evaluate button on the toolbar. The result will appear in an output cell below the input cell.
 
For example, try entering the following code in an input cell and evaluate it:
 `2+2` 
You should see the following output:
 `4` 
You can edit your input cells by clicking on them and making changes. You can also copy and paste your input and output cells using the standard keyboard shortcuts or the Edit menu.
 
### The Documentation Center
 
If you need help with using Wolfram Mathematica 8, you can access the Documentation Center by choosing Help > Wolfram Documentation. The Documentation Center contains tutorials, guides, reference pages, examples, and more for all the features and functions of Wolfram Mathematica 8. You can search for topics using the search box or browse through the categories on the left panel.
 
For example, if you want to learn more about how to plot functions, you can type "plot" in the search box and press Enter. You will see a list of relevant pages, such as "Plot", "Plotting Functions", "Basic Plotting", and more. You can click on any page to view its content. You can also copy and paste code from the documentation pages to your notebooks and evaluate them.
